# Digital-Design
Some work in the course Digital Design in 2019-2020 Fall Semester



## Something to say about this course

Firstly, thanks to my course instructor Georgios Theodoropoulos, he taught me a lot on basic computer architectures. Although I never remember his name exactly.:smile:

Secondly, thanks to my TA Wei Wang, who is meticulous on her teaching, but always makes me sleepy.:smiley:

The final project is about a simple VGA. Also thanks to my partners: Shilong Li and Jiaxi Zhang. I'm looking forward to working with you guys again if it is possible.
